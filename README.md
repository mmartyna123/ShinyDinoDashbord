# Dinosaur Explorer Dashboard

---

Welcome to the Dinosaur Explorer Dashboard! This project offers an interactive and educational way to explore the distribution and characteristics of dinosaur species across different geological periods and regions. Designed for Data Visualization classes at PUT, this dashboard leverages dynamic data visualization tools to make learning about prehistoric life both engaging and informative.

## Features
- **Explore Geographical Distribution:** View regions where various dinosaur species were discovered using an interactive map.
- **Search for Specific Dinosaurs:** Use the "Find Your Dinosaur" table to filter and search for dinosaurs by attributes like period, diet, region, and length.
- **Analyze Dinosaur Lengths:** Compare the lengths of different dinosaur species through violin plots based on dietary categories, geological periods, and other characteristics.
- **Investigate Length Relationships:** Use scatter plots to illustrate the relationship between dinosaur lengths and other characteristics such as diet and period.
- **Examine Dietary Habits:** Understand the dietary distribution of dinosaurs using a pie chart that categorizes them into carnivorous, herbivorous, omnivorous, and others.
- **Study Dinosaur Types:** View the distribution of different dinosaur types across the Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Triassic periods with bar charts.
